This simple JavaScript application allows users to trigger a specific action by entering the Konami code using their keyboard.

## Description

The Konami code, famously known as a cheat code in various video games, is a sequence of keystrokes that, when entered, triggers a specific action. In this application, the Konami code is "ujjawal". When the user types this sequence, it activates the `cornify_add()` function, which adds unicorns and rainbows to the webpage.
